The base code for the anomaly detection is already developed. The feedback mechanism should allow users to provide input on the algorithm's performance, such as marking false positives or negatives, and this input should be used to improve the algorithm over time. The code should be complete and executable, without any empty code blocks.","md5":"5411bbf52e5339331abee271a7ac7428"},{"prompt":"I need a Python script named 'feedback.py' for an anomaly detection system. This script should allow users to provide feedback on the detected anomalies, such as confirming or rejecting them as true anomalies. The feedback should be stored and used to improve the anomaly detection algorithm over time. The script must be compatible with an existing Python code that processes time series sensor data from a wastewater treatment plant. Ensure that the script is complete and does not contain placeholder code.","md5":"5d765e0c4c638bf71de5f1fa8b3ac838"}]}
