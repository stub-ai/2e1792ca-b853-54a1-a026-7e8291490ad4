The base code for the anomaly detection is already developed. The feedback mechanism should allow users to provide input on the algorithm's performance, such as marking false positives or negatives, and this input should be used to improve the algorithm over time. The code should be complete and executable, without any empty code blocks.","md5":"5411bbf52e5339331abee271a7ac7428"},{"prompt":"I need a Python script for a feedback mechanism in an anomaly detection system. This script should enable users to review the detected anomalies and provide feedback, marking them as true or false positives. The feedback should be recorded and used to refine the anomaly detection algorithm. The script should be compatible with an existing anomaly detection algorithm that processes time series sensor data from a SCADA system. The script must be complete, executable, and should not contain placeholder code.","md5":"055c839521e31a6b1e9b03973dcf0fe0"}]}
